This repository contains a simple Elixir program that demonstrates a common error: type mismatch in function arguments.  The `bug.ex` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ex` provides a corrected version. The error arises because the function `my_function` attempts to add a number and a string, which is not a valid operation in Elixir.  The solution shows how to handle this error by either ensuring the input types are consistent or using pattern matching to handle different types appropriately.
